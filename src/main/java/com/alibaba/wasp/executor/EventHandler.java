/**
 * Abstract base class for all wasp event handlers. Subclasses should implement
 * the {@link #process()} method. Subclasses should also do all necessary checks
 * up in their constructor if possible -- check table exists, is disabled, etc.
 * -- so they fail fast rather than later when process is running. Do it this
 * way because process be invoked directly but event handlers are also run in an
 * executor context -- i.e. asynchronously -- and in this case, exceptions
 * thrown at process time will not be seen by the invoker, not till we implement
 * a call-back mechanism so the client can pick them up later.
 * <p>
 * Event handlers have an {@link EventType}. {@link EventType} is a list of ALL
 * handler event types. We need to keep a full list in one place -- and as enums
 * is a good shorthand for an implemenations -- because event handlers can be
 * passed to executors when they are to be run asynchronously. The wasp
 * executor, see {@link ExecutorService}, has a switch for passing event type to
 * executor.
 * <p>
 * Event listeners can be installed and will be called pre- and post- process if
 * this EventHandler is run in a Thread (its a Runnable so if its {@link #run()}
 * method gets called). Implement {@link EventHandlerListener}s, and registering
 * using {@link #setListener(EventHandlerListener)}.
